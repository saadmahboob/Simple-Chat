# Simple-Chat

This is a simple chat application. I have launched this project to give some examples on how I use my favorites front-end tools.

Feel free to add a new feature or correct if I do something in an unconventional way I'm not an expert.

What is used in this project:
- nodeJs ---> for the chat server side
- AngularJs ---> my favorite front-end framework I can't do a project without this
- Velocity Js ---> this is a very good framework when you want to do animation (I have never use this before)
- Socket.io ---> for the chat client and server side
- twitter bootstrap ---> to have a responsive application
- Grunt ---> 
- Bower --->
- ... ---> why ?
